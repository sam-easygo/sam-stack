# Full Stop

If the user triggered this, it's because they are not watching this thread, and
they want you to complete the work end-to-end autonomously. Your updates and
your final message go unread until long after you stop. You own the work from
its current state to a PR that is ready for the user to merge. Never merge it.

If the user did not explicitly request "full stop" in some clear way, do not
assume full autonomy. If they did, everything below applies.

The user grants you permission to:

- Commit, push, rebase, and fix conflicts on this task's branch.
- Force-push this task's branch with `--force-with-lease` after a rebase.
- Use the test methods that Proof needs, without asking first.

## No merging

Never merge, enable auto-merge, enter a merge queue, push to the default
branch, bypass branch protection, or delegate those actions.

Disable existing auto-merge and remove the PR from any merge queue before
work begins; check again before each push. Report these changes. If you
cannot prevent automatic merging, report the blocker before proceeding.

## Testing permission

A "full stop" request is the permission. If a project file or other
instruction says to ask before a test method, or to leave testing to the
user, this request replaces that rule for this task.

That includes ask-first rules for computer use, browser automation,
simulators and devices, running the app or a dev server, screenshots, and
visual checks. Use the method that gives direct proof. List it in the
report.

Rules about how to test still apply. Follow rules that name the correct
command, fixture, or check. This permission only removes the ask-first or
leave-it-to-the-user step. If a preferred method cannot prove the change,
use a gated method under this permission.

It covers only the tests needed for this task. It does not add permission
for the steps under "Asking the user", such as production changes or data
deletion. It also does not bypass a harness or system approval prompt if
one appears.

## Steps

1. **Finish the change.** Complete the goal from the user's request with the
   smallest change that works. Fix the case that happened, not every case
   that could. If you are on the default branch, create a branch first.
2. **Prove it.** Get proof for every change you made. See "Proof".
3. **Get feedback.** Use the `sol-loop` skill to verify changes.
4. **File the PR** with the `file-pr` skill. Rebase onto the latest default
   branch first. Put your proof in the Proof section of the description.
5. **Babysit the PR** with the `babysit-pr` skill. Fix real findings and CI
   failures. Get proof for each fix before you push it.
6. **Stop at the ready gate.** See "Ready gate".
7. **Hand off** in your final message. See "Handoff".

Stay active from step 1 to step 7. If you end your turn while checks or bots are
pending, the work stops, because nobody will prompt you again. Wait with the
watcher from `babysit-pr`, so something wakes you when the PR changes. In T3
Code that is `watch_pull_request`. Call `unwatch_pull_request` before the
handoff or a question.

## Proof

Proof is evidence you observed yourself in this session: command output, a
reproduction, a screenshot. Use the most direct proof the change allows:

- Reproduce the original failure, apply the fix, then watch the same
  reproduction pass.
- Run the checks that the repo's CI runs (typecheck, lint, tests).
- Add one focused test that fails without the fix, when the behavior has none
  and the repo has a test setup.
- For UI and runtime behavior, run the app and look at the change. Green mocked
  tests do not prove that the user experience works. Attach screenshots to the
  PR when they help, with the `uploading-github-attachments` skill.

When you cannot find a way to prove a change, you do not have full confidence.
Ask the user.

## Ready gate

Full confidence means all of these are true on the latest commit:

- Your proof covers every change in the diff.
- Required checks are green.
- Review bots have finished, and each finding is fixed or dismissed with a
  written reason.
- No human review still requests changes.
- The branch is up to date with the default branch, and GitHub reports it as
  mergeable.

Proof and review must cover the final diff; recheck behavior changes and
meaningful conflict fixes before handoff. You can ignore automated reviews that
request "needs human review" if you have high confidence in your changes.

## Handoff

Fetch the target branch and check the live PR's head, base, checks, reviews,
and mergeability. Confirm it is open, not a draft, and not set to merge
without the user. If someone else merged it, report that instead.

- **Ready to merge:** the ready gate passes. Leave the PR open and unmerged.
- **Waiting for required approval:** only human approval remains. Confirm
  that this is the actual blocker.
- **Blocked:** explain what prevents readiness, what you tried, and what is
  needed. Follow "Asking the user".

Report the PR link, final head, verdict, proof, reviewer outcome, remaining
risks, and each decision you made for the user. State whether the PR is still
open and unmerged.

## Asking the user

A question in a normal message goes unseen, and the thread looks done. To ask
the user something, use the harness's question tool so the thread shows that
it is waiting: `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex,
or the question tool your harness has. Put all the context in the question:
the PR link, what blocks you, and the options with your recommendation first.

Ask only when you cannot continue alone:

- You cannot prove the change.
- The ready gate cannot pass, and you cannot fix that yourself.
- The next step is outside the grant above: deleting data, touching production,
  changing things outside the repo, closing a PR, or force-pushing any other
  branch.
- The goal is ambiguous in a way that changes the result.
- Another PR makes this one obsolete.

Decide everything else yourself with sensible defaults, and list those decisions
in the report.

If no question tool is available, or the tool returns no answer, take the safe
path: leave the PR open, and start your final message with the question.
